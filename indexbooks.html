        <img src="assets/becoming.jpg">
        <p4>In Becoming we get a glimpse of Michelle Obama's life through her eyes. We learn how early memories leave an impact at even a yougn age
            and that failure is only a feeling before it actually becomes true:"Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result. It’s 
            vulnerability that breeds with self-doubt and then is escalated, often deliberately, by fear." Attending Princeton Michelle Obama
            often wondered who or what she was representing. She shares with us why she chose to stand by her husband during the presidential
            elections even though she was never a fan of politics. A book that shows the strengh and determination of Michelle Obama in her own words,
            a book worth reading.</p4>
